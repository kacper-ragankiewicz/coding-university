# Tracking your progress in *coding-interview-university* with Github.

## ***>>> Script doesn't work if you don't stay in track daily!!***

# **How to run it**

Script is written in C++

To compile it from .cpp, you need to have gcc installed.

check gcc:

```
$ gcc -v
```

or just run it using:

```
$ chmod +x main & ./main
```

# **Staring new count**

### To start new counting, remove **data.txt** and swap **coding_university.md** with yours.

*To get new coding-university.md, visit  [jwasham / coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)*

# **How to use it**

### After marking on coding_university.md from " **- [ ]** " to " **- [X]** ", run the script.

The script will compare the value with the previous days and will tell you with such an average per day how many days you have left until the end of the script.


# **Architecture**

**main.cpp** *- its main c++ script where you can make changes*


**coding_university.md** *- this is the source md file (you can swap it with your file and progres)*

**data.txt** *- it's where your date with progress is stored*

****algorithm.md** *- notes with basic implementation of useful algorithms*

****algorithm_interview.md** *- notes with useful algorithms for leetcode and hackerrank*
